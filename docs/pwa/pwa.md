# Progressive Web App tools

!> **WARNING** These features are for advanced purposes only and have some significant drawbacks in their first implementation. Keep an eye out for a more robust implementation in the future!

The App Platform provides some tools that can enable some PWA features and offline caching.

### Opting In

You can opt in to PWA features using options in `d2.config.json`. Here are the options and their effects:

| `pwa.caching.additionalManifestEntries` | Array of Objects with signature `{ revision: String, url: String }` | A list of files that can be added to the precache manifest. Note that the service worker uses Workbox to precache all static assets that end up in the ‘build’ folder after the CRA compilation and build step during the d2-app-scripts build process. The format of this list must match the [required format for Workbox precache manifests](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching#explanation_of_the_precache_list), i.e. it must include a revision hash to inform when that file needs to be updated in the precache. |

### Offline caching

If PWA is enabled, a service worker will be registered in the scope of the app that will perform offline caching by default using a few strategies with the help of Workbox:

1. Static assets that are part of the app’s `build` directory will be **precached.** After the app loads, the service worker will fetch all the static assets and add them to the Workbox precache, and they will be served cache-first from then on. Workbox makes sure these files are up-to-date by adding revision hashes to the files and updating files accordingly. For more details, see [“Workbox Precaching”](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching).
2. Other requests made by the app will be handled by default by two other strategies, and they both will be subject to a configurable **URL filter** (see `pwa.caching` options in the table above) to determine if a request should be cached or not.
    1. Requests for static assets will be handled by a **stale-while-revalidate** strategy.
    2. Requests for data will be handled by a **network-first** strategy.
    3. To learn more about these strategies, see [“Workbox Strategies”](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-strategies)

Requests to URLs that are filtered out by the URL filtering options above will not be handled by the service worker, except during “recording mode” when _all_ requests are handled.

### Recording mode and “cacheable sections”

A special caching use case has been developed with the intention of supporting caching individual dashboards for offline. Here are some characateristics of cases where it’s useful:

-   There are sections of an app you _don’t want to cache by default,_ but do want to be able to cache when a user requests it. Consider the dashboards app: it is useful to save some dashboards for offline use, but it would be impractical to cache _all_ of a user’s (potentiall many) dashboards by default.
-   You want to track the caching status of those sections, i.e. if a section is cached or not and when it was last updated

(To do: more useful background)

#### React API

(To do: finish this)

To make a section of an app available for offline use (that would otherwise not be cached by the default strategies, for example if the content is filtered out by URLs), like an individual dashboard in the Dashboards app, wrap that section in a `<CacheableSection id={id}>` component and provide it an ID. To access the caching status of that section and to trigger caching “recording,” use the `useCacheableSection` hook keyed by that section’s ID

#### Service worker design

When “recording mode” is used and a “recording session” is triggered, the service worker listens to all network traffic and caches all the request/response pairs. In order to capture all the requests and responses for a section that triggers a _cascade_ of requests as subcomponents of that section load and trigger more requests, the service worker will continue recording traffic after all pending requests have finished, up to a configurable timeout delay. If any new requests are initiated before the end of that delay, the delay will be canceled and will start again when all pending requests have finished again. This delay should be configured so that all the cascading requests make it in to the recorded section without prematurely stopping the recording and missing relevant requests.

As a measure to protect against saving faulty recordings, once the recording timeout has elapsed and the recording is moving to finish, the service worker will send a message to the client to confirm that this recording should be completed and saved. The client needs to send back a confirmation message within a 10 second timeout, or the recording will be scrapped. If the service worker receives confirmation, it will save the cached request/response pairs for that section and write some metadata about the recorded section in an IndexedDB.

### Service worker messages

A number of messages are sent between the service worker and a client using the `postMessage` interface to communicate and initiate different actions.

| **Message type (event.data.type)**                              | **Sent by? (SW or Client)** | **Payload expected (event.data.payload)**  | **Event**                                             | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
